# BoydsBlog

This was a project done to learn the basics of Ruby on Rails. It includes a blog home page that displays written articles, as well as a system for readers to comment on an article.

<i>Best security practices were not addressed in this project and users can create articles using the hardcoded <strong>username: 'admin' password: 'password'.</strong></i>

This site is hosted using Heroku's free plan at https://boydsblog.herokuapp.com/.
